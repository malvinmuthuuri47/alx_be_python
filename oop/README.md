# More About OOP

This project dives deeper into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

You'll explore advanced concepts like constructors, destructors, magic methods, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and more.

## Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Describe the functionalities of constructors (<span style="color:red">__init__</span>), destructors (<span style="color:red">__del__</span>), and common magic methods (e.g., <span style="color:red">__str__, __repr__</span>) in Python classes.
- Implement inheritance to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
- Utilize composition as an alternative to inheritance for bulding complex objects.
- Explain the concepts of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in Python.
- Understand the method resolution order (MRO) in Python and how it affects method calls in inheritance hierarchies.
- Implement polymorphism and method overiding to create flexible and reusable code.
- Explain and use Python's duck typing to achieve polymorphic behavior.
- Distinguish between class methods and static methods based on their usage and purpose.
- Apply <span style="color:red">@classmethod</span> and <span style="color:red">@staticmethod</span> decorators appropriately in your Python classes.

> [!NOTE]
> ## Project Tasks
> 1. Task One - This task dives into Python Magic methods and expects you to understand how to use constructors, destructors, string representations **(__str__)**, and official representations **(__repr__)**
> 2. Task Two - This task dives into mastering inheritance and composition in Python.
> 3. Task Three - This task dives into exploring Polymorphism and Method overloading in Python.
> 4. Task Four - This task helps distinguish between class methods and static methods
