# Introducing Logic into Programming (Control flow and loops)

> [!NOTE]
> **This project dives into the world of control flow and loops, essential concepts for introducing logic into your Python programs. You'll learn how to make decisions using conditional statements and automate repetitive tasks using loops.**

## Project Objectives
> [!NOTE]
> By the end of this project, you should be able to:
> - Explain the concept of control flow and its role in programming.
> - Utilize conditional statemtents (if, else, elif) to control the flow of execution in your python code based on specific conditions.
> - Write practical examples demonstrating the use of conditional statements for decision-making.
> - Understand the concept of Match Case statements introduced in Python 3.10 as an alternative to multiple if/elif statements (optional for Python versions below 3.10).
> - Explain the advantages of Match Case statements for handling multiple conditions.
> - Implement Match Case statements using proper syntax, including matching against specific values and types (optional for Python versions below 3.10).
> - Apply best practices for using Match Case statements to enhance code readiblity and efficiency (optional for Python versions below 3.10).
> - Grasp the purpose and different types of loops available in Python.
> - utilize for loops to iterate over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc.) efficiently.
> - Write examples demonstrating how to use for loops to iterate over various data structures.
> - Explain the concept of while loops and how they differ from for loops.
> - Implement while loops in Python to execute code repeatedly as long as a specific condition remains true.
> - Understand nested loops (loops within loops) and their applications in scenarios like working with multidimensional data or creating patterns.

### Project Tasks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Weather Recommendation Program.
> This program provides a wardrobe(clothes) recommendation to the user based on the current weather conditions as inputted by the user.

> 2. A Calculator program.
> This program implements a calculator functionality but with the use of Match case statements.

> 3. A Multiplication Table generator
> This program asks a user to enter a number and then calculates the multiples of that number upto 10 and prints them out.

> 4. Drawing patterns with Nested loops
> This program draws a square pattern using an asterisk (&ast;) as many times as specified by the user input

> 5. A Personal daily reminder
> This program implements functionality to remind a user about a task based on the priority level and whether the task is time-bound
