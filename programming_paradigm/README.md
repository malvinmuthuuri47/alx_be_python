# Programming Paradigms & Exception Handling

> [!NOTE]
> This project introduces you to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and Exception Handling. You'll learn about classes, objects, the benefits of OOP, explore how to handle errors gracefully, and be introduced to the basics of testing.

> [!TIP]
> ## Project Objectives
> By the end of this project, you should be able to:
> - Explain the core concepts of OOP: classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction.
> - Discuss teh significance of OOP in software development and its advantages over other programming paradigms.
> - Define classes and create objects in Python.
> - Understand the difference between class attributes, instance methods, and the role of the <span style="color:red">self</span> keyword within classes.
> - Differentiate between syntax errors and exceptions in Python.
> - Identify common Python exceptions and understand their causes.
> - Utilize <span style="color:red">try, except, else</span> and <span style="color:red">finally</span> blocks to handle exceptions effectively.
> - Raise exceptions using the <span style="color:red">raise</span> keyword and create custom exceptions for specific errors in your code.
> - Explain the importance of testing in software development.
> - Describe different types of testing, with a focus on unit testing.
> - Write basic unit tests using Python's <span style="color:red">unittest</span> module to verify the functionality of your code.
> - Structure test cases effectively and understand how test runners work.
> This project equips you with the foundational knowledge of OOP and exception handling in Python. These skills are essential for building well-structured, maintainable, and robust Python applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Task One implements a Bank account class with deposit, withdraw, and display_balance methods. It implements this using OOP concepts such as encapsulation for banking operations.
> 2. Task Two implements a Division calculator with command line arguments and handles mathematical errors such as division by zero and non-numeric inputs.
> 3. Task Three writes unit tests for a calculator class provided. It tests the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division methods using the unittest module.
> 4. Task Four implements a Library management system using OOP concepts. It defines two classes for books and a library and implements methods that define the typical behavior in libraries such as borrowing books and returning books if they are available
