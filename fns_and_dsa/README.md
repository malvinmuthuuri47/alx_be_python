# Functions, Data Structures, and Modules

> This project delves into the fundamentals of functions, data structures, and modules in Python. You'll explore how to define and utilize functions, effectively manage data using various built-in structures, and elverage modules and libraries to extend Python's capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> ## **Project Objectives**
> By the end of this project, you should be able to:
> - Define the purpose and importance of functions in Python programming.
> - Construct functions using <span style="color:red">*def*</span> and <span style="color:red">*lambda*</span> keywords, understanding proper syntax.
> - Work with function parameters, argument passing mechanisms, default values, and keyword arguments.
> - Explain the concept of return values and utilize the <span style="color:red">return</span> statement effectively.
> - Distinguish between local and global varialbe scope within functions.
> - Apply <span style="color:red">global</span> and <span style="color:red">nonlocal<span> keywords appropriately to manage variable scope.
> Identify common Python data structures: *Lists, Tuple, Sets, and Dictionaries.*
> - Select the appropriate data structure based on the type of data and operations needed.
> - Perform operations on Lists *(Indexing, slicing, appending, etc.)*.
> - Utilize Dictionary methods, understand the immutability of Tuples, and perform Set operations.
> - Explain the concepts of modules and packagas in Python.
> - Create and use custom modules, and import standard modules provided by Python.
> - Install and use external Python libraries using pip.
> - Identify some essential Python libraries and their functionalities (e.h., <span style="color:red">requests</span>).
> - Comprehend the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) for understanding variable scope in Python.
> - Implement best practices for effective variable scope management.
> - Explain the concept of namespaces in Python and differentiate between their types.
> - Describe the lifecycle of a namespace and how scope resolution works in Python.

## This project equips you with the building blocks for creating well-organized and efficient Python programs. By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Task one - Create a module with a function that performs basic arithmetic operations. This function will be imported and used in a separate main.py script.
> 2. Task Two - Utilize Python lists to create a simple shopping list manager that allows users to add items, view the current list, and remove items.
> 3. Task Three - Create a python script that you will use to perform operations with dates and times from the <span style="color:red">datetime</span> module.
> 4. Task Four - Create a script that demonstrates the concept of varialbe scope by creating a script that converts temperatures between *Celcuis* and *Fahrenheit*, using global variables to store conversion factors.
